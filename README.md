# GYE_Birds
Repository for Towards Assesing the Ecological Health of Birds in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem

This project is being performed as part of a Research Assistantship in conjunction with Montana State University and the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee.

## Goal: Demonstrate an approach for monitoring the ecological health of bird populations and communities across federal lands of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE).

## Objectives applicable to this repository:
 * Compile data from the USFWS Breeding Bird Survey and the USFS Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions programs
 * Select bird species for which these data sets allow rigorous statistical modeling of population trends
 * Use species distribution modeling techniques to develop spatially explicit models of bird abundance as a function of biophysical and human pressure factors for the period of 1990-2024
 * Use the models to project bird abundances under alternative future climate and land use scenarios
 * Use statistical techniques to evaluate trend past to present and into the future and compile the results into a color-coded report card for communication with diverse stakeholders.
